# Gemini-clone

This project is a Gemini-inspired interface built with React, designed to showcase clean layout work, smooth UI structure, and a minimal, modern home screen experience. It includes a welcoming header, neatly arranged quick-action cards, and a responsive layout that adapts well across devices. The interface is organized with reusable components, making the flow easy to understand and navigate. The goal was to capture the calm, polished feel of an AI assistant’s homepage while demonstrating solid React fundamentals, thoughtful styling, and clear component design.
